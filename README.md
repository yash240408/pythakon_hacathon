#  PYTHAKON

## Description

The Pythakon is an **IOT Based Railway Accident Prevention System** ,initially made for 36 hour hackathon at Charusat University (PS : WE WON THAT HACKATHON) .
- Rail accidents are one of the major issues till the present day. Despite safety measures, at least one major accident is recorded every year. 
- The aim of this project is to present a handy module consisting of sensors and micro systems which are used to detect faults which cause accidents.
- Through this project we are  making a device that will alert the people or vehicles at level crossing that a train is coming and it will also make a siren. So that the people get aware that the train is coming and
they have to wait till the train crosses.

### Configuration

- `Present a handy module consisting of sensors and microsystems which are used to detect faults which cause accidents`.
- `The causes of accidents are categorized into different modules which include anti-collision,track detection, object detection, level crossing and detect the presence of the guard at level crossing`.

## Getting Started

   ### Deployment
- To run this project, install it locally and you'll need hardware support(esp 8266) for this you'll need sensors too.
- You can deploy the site for attendence from the specific folder. It is made for:)
     

For help getting started with IOT development, view the
[online documentation](https://www.internetsociety.org/iot/), which offers help on IOT development, and a full API reference.
